Some of them posted about it but the majority haven't.\n\nYou know why?\n\nBecause speaking up doesn’t pay.\n\nThere’s no brand deal. No affiliate code. No likes from corporate recruiters. No 'collaboration opportunity.'\n\nJust a simple truth: If it's not profitable, it’s not worth talking about.\n\nInfluencing has become a business, not a responsibility. And when real issues happen - issues that affect people, that deserve voices they go quiet.\n\nBecause silence is safer.\n\nBecause this issue won’t get them engagement - it could cost them everything.\n\n– They might lose followers\n– Upset brands\n– Offend recruiters\n– Be labelled 'controversial'\n– Lose out on collabs and visibility\n\nThis post might not get me likes or money. But if even one person starts questioning the silence of people they follow, it’s worth it.\n\nAnd if the people with thousands of followers, with platforms, with reach… choose not to speak - then what are they even influencing?\n\nBeing an influencer doesn’t mean being brand-friendly.\n\nIt means having the guts to stand up, even when it’s uncomfortable.\n\nEven when it hurts your reach, followers. Even when it affects your paycheck.\n\nUse your voice for more than brand deals.\n\nOr stop calling yourself an influencer.\n\nSo the next time you see someone flexing their 'personal brand' and hashtag#InfluencerLife, ask them one question:\n\nWhat do you stand for when no one’s watching?\n\nHere's one person posting an offer letter that looks like it's made on the word with an affiliate link and I'll leave it up to you now, decide who you want to support!",
